                                    The Discover page of Not Ok, Cupid allows
                                    users to browse and interact with other

                                    profiles. If two users dislike each other, a
                                    mismatch is created and they can message
                                    each other through the app. All disliked
                                    users will populate on the dislikes page.
                                    Additionally, users can update their
                                    personal information, including their age,
                                    gender, and preferred gender. The Discover
                                    page provides a fun and intuitive way for
                                    users to find potential mismatches and
                                    connect with others.

                                    is an important aspect of the matchmaking
                                    process, as it helps users to focus their
                                    search and find more suitable mismatches.
                                    Overall, the Dislikes page is a useful tool
                                    for managing and organizing dislikes on the

                                <p>
                                    The Mismatches page of Not Ok, Cupid is
                                    where users can find and connect with
                                    mismatches. If two users both dislike each
                                    other, a mismatch is generated and they are
                                    able to message each other through the app.
                                    This page provides users with a unique
                                    opportunity to connect with others who don't
                                    have mutual interests, allowing them to
                                    bypass the initial step of making unlikely
                                    friends. The Mismatches page is accessible
                                    from the Mismatches tab and displays a list
                                    of the current users Mismatches. By using
                                    the mismatches page, users can quickly and
                                    easily find and communicate with mismatches,
                                    helping to facilitate deeper connections and
                                    relationships.

                                    <p>
                                        On Not Ok Cupid, users can easily
                                        message their mismatches through the
                                        app. A mismatch is created when two
                                        users both dislike each other. Once a
                                        mismatch has been established, users can
                                        access the conversation from the
                                        Mismatches page on their profile. The
                                        messaging feature allows users to
                                        communicate with their mismatches in
                                        real-time, providing them with the
                                        opportunity to get to know each other
                                        and potentially form deeper connections.
                                        The messaging feature is user-friendly
                                        and intuitive, making it easy for users
                                        to start conversations and connect with
                                        others on Not Ok Cupid.

                                    <p>
                                        Not Ok Cupid allows users to answer personality questions, providing insight into their interests, preferences, and values. The questions are designed to be fun and cheeky, helping users to showcase their personality and connect with others who don't share similar interests. When viewing other users' profiles, the personality questions also generate a mismatch percentage, indicating the number of questions answered differently between the current user and the other user. The mismatch percentage provides users with a quick and easy way to gauge their incompatibility with other users, helping them to make informed decisions about who to connect with.
